## Why Weekly Report?

It's because the following article makes sense to me and I really want to use such system.

[Silicon Valleyâ€™s Productivity Secret](http://blog.idonethis.com/post/16736314554/silicon-valleys-productivity-secret)

But the introduced system is not opensource. So I created this.
